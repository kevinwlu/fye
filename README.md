  * [Candy apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_apple)
  * [Tanghulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanghulu)

* Here are some examples of lollipop moments: 
  * A stranger's conversation: A conversation with a stranger that leads to a new job opportunity
  * Words of wisdom: Someone says the exact words you need to hear during a difficult time 
  * Unexpected interaction: Someone comes up to you unexpectedly and makes you feel like you matter 
* Dudley describes two main components of a lollipop moment:
  * Speaker: Someone who verbalizes words of wisdom or truth
  * Receiver: Someone who receives and internalizes the new idea or thought 
* Real [leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership) is most evident in the small moments that occur throughout the day, such as lollipop moments
